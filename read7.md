### group norms
Norms are the traditions, behavioral standards and unwritten rules that govern how we function when we gather.

### nouns
Machines don't have a universal noun

Every programming language, database, or other kind of 
system has a different way of talking about nouns.

URL is so important because It let's all of the systems tell each other about each other's nouns.

the browser does an HTTP GET on the URL you type in and back comes a web page. The web page just specifies the URLs to the images and the browser goes and does more GETs using the HTTP protocol on them until all the resources are obtained and the web page is displayed

systems would retrieve information from each other use 'HTTP GET'.

If one system needs to add something to another system use an 'HTTP POST'.

If a system wants to replace something in another system use an 'HTTP PUT'

to do a partial update use 'PATCH'.

### Request basics

A request can be initiated by invoking the appropriate method on the 'request' object, then calling '.then()'
