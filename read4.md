### CSS Grid

#### What is the CSS Grid Layout used for?
Flexbox is one-dimensional. The elements are, in principle, only moved along an axis. A CSS Grid Layout provides the web designer with two dimensions for placing objects. Instead of just one axis, with CSS Grid, you can use a grid that has rows and columns.

CSS Grid is familiar with two different units: containers und items. The container is the upper level where one determines properties that are then passed on to all items. An item thus lies (viewed hierarchically) within a container.


### Grid, columns, and rows
With CSS Grid, youâ€™ll work with rows and columns and in this way produce a grid. Within the grid, individual objects can be arranged. This grid can or must be freely selected.
#### Example 
.grid-container {
  display: grid;

  grid-template-rows: 100px 100px;
  
  grid-template-columns: 100px 100px 100px;
}
