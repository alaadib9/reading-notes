### What is SQL?
SQL, or Structured Query Language, is a language designed to allow both technical and non-technical users query, manipulate, and transform data from a relational database.

### Relational databases
relational database represents a collection of related (two-dimensional) tables. Each of the tables are similar to an Excel spreadsheet, with a fixed number of named columns (the attributes or properties of the table) and any number of rows of data.

### Filtering and sorting Query results
SQL provides a convenient way to discard rows that have a duplicate column value by using the 'DISTINCT' keyword.

### Ordering results
SQL provides a way to sort the results by a given column in ascending or descending order using the 'ORDER BY' clause
