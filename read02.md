## JQuery

jQuery is a JavaScript Library.
The purpose of jQuery is to make it much easier to use JavaScript on your website.

### Using jQuery
At its core, jQuery is used to connect with HTML elements in the browser via the DOM.

The Document Object Model (DOM) is the method by which JavaScript (and jQuery) interact with the HTML in a browser.

### Selectors
To access a selector, use the jQuery symbol $, followed by parentheses ().

### $("*") - Wildcard: selects every element on the page.
### $(this) - Current: selects the current element being operated on within a function.
### $("p") - Tag: selects every instance of the <p> tag.
### $(".example") - Class: selects every element that has the example class applied to it.
### $("#example") - Id: selects a single instance of the unique example id.
### $("[type='text']") - Attribute: selects any element with text applied to the type attribute.
### $("p:first-of-type") - Pseudo Element: selects the first <p>
